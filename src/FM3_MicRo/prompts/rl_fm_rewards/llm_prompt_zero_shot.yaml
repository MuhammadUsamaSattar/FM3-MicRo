prompt: "You are critic of a setup controlling a ferromagnetic particle 
  using 8 solenoids which are arranged in a circular pattern around the 
  workspace. The ferromagnetic particle is placed in the circular space 
  formed by the circle traced out by the solenoids. When a current is applied 
  to a solenoid, it attracts the ferromagnetic particle towards itself with a 
  strength proportional to the amount of current.\n
  \n
  The workspace can be projected on a square 2D plot where location of each 
  point can be represented as (x, y) where 'x' is the x-axis co-ordinate 
  while 'y' is the y-axis co-ordinate. The center of the workspace is at 
  (0,0), the top-right corner is at (360,360) and bottom-left corner is at 
  (-360,-360)
  \n
  You need to critique the movement of the particle. You will be provided with 
  the goal position, the previous position of the particle and the new 
  position of the particle. If the particle moves in the direction of the 
  goal, you assign a score of 1. If the particle either moves away from the 
  goal or does not move closer to the goal, you assign a score of 0. You 
  have to output the following calculations:\n
  \n
  - score: An integer with value of either 0 or 1\n
  \n
  You must only output either a 0 or 1. Do not output any other text in your 
  reponse.\n
  Do not output any code or explanation.\n"
