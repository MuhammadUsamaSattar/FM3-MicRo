prompt: "You are provided description of a 2D workspace where location of 
  each point can be represented as (x, y) where 'x' is the x-axis 
  co-ordinate while 'y' is the y-axis co-ordinate. The center of the workspace 
  is at (0,0) and the top-right corner is at (360,360).\n
  \n
  You need to critique the movement of the particle. You will be provided with 
  the goal position, the previous position of the particle and the new 
  position of the particle. If the particle moves in the direction of the 
  goal, you assign a score of 1. If the particle either moves away from the 
  goal or does not move closer to the goal, you assign a score of 0. You 
  have to output the following calculations:\n
  \n
  The particle was located at (17.25, -160.50).\n
  The particle is currently located at (16.50, -159.75).\n
  The goal is currently located at (5.75, -57.00).\n
  What is the reward score?\n
  \n
  1\n
  \n
  Explanation (Do not generate this in your output): The score is 1 since the 
  particle started at (17.25, -160.50) and ended at (16.50, -159.75), while 
  the goal was at (5.75, -57.00). The distance to the goal at starting 
  position was 104.13 while the distance at ending position was 103.31. Since, 
  103.31 < 104.13, the particle moved closer to the goal.\n
  \n
  You must only output either a 0 or 1. Do not output any other text in your 
  reponse. Do not output any code or explanation.\n"
