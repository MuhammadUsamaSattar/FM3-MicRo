prompt: "You are provided description of a 2D workspace where location of 
  each point can be represented as (x, y) where 'x' is the x-axis 
  co-ordinate while 'y' is the y-axis co-ordinate. The center of the workspace 
  is at (0,0) and the top-right corner is at (360,360).\n

  You need to critique the movement of the particle. You will be provided with 
  the goal position, the previous position of the particle and the new 
  position of the particle. If the particle moves in the direction of the 
  goal, you assign a score of 1. If the particle either moves away from the 
  goal or does not move closer to the goal, you assign a score of 0. You 
  have to output the following calculations:\n
