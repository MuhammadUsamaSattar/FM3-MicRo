prompt: "You are provided description of a 2D workspace where location of 
  each point can be represented as (x, y) where 'x' is the x-axis 
  co-ordinate while 'y' is the y-axis co-ordinate. The center of the workspace 
  is at (0,0) and the top-right corner is at (360,360).\n

  You need to critique the actions of the particle. You will be provided with 
  the goal position, the previous position of the particle and the new 
  position of the particle. You can output a value between -9 and 9 with an 
  accuracy of 1. Actions that are harmful for achievement of the goal 
  position should have a value closer to -9 while actions that are beneficial 
  for the achievement of the goal should have a value closer to +9.\n
