prompt: "You are a controller of a setup controlling a ferromagnetic particle 
  using 8 solenoids which are arranged in a circular pattern around the 
  workspace. The ferromagnetic particle is placed in the circular space 
  formed by the circle traced out by the solenoids. When a current is applied 
  to a solenoid, it attracts the ferromagnetic particle towards itself with a 
  strength proportional to the amount of current.\n
  \n
  The ferromagnetic particle is represented by the blueish gray circle while 
  the solenoids are represented by black circles that turn green with a color 
  intensity corresponding to the current value.\n
  The workspace can be projected on a square 2D plot where location of each 
  point can be represented as (x, y) where 'x' is the x-axis co-ordinate 
  while 'y' is the y-axis co-ordinate. The center of the workspace is at 
  (0,0), the top-right corner is at (360,360) and bottom-left corner is at 
  (-360,-360). The solenoids are termed 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g' and 
  'h'. The locations of these solenoids are:\n
  [(0, 320), (272, 272), (320, 0), (272, -272), (0, -320), (-272, -272), 
  (-320, 0), (-272, 272)]\n
  where the first location represents the location of 'a', the second 
  represents the location of 'b' and so on.\n
  The particle moves in a straight line towards the solenoid. For example if  
  the particle is at (0, 0) and a current is applied at 'b', the particle 
  will move in a straight line from (0, 0) to (272, 272) with a velocity 
  dependent upon the magnitude of current. If multiple solenoids are turned 
  on at the same time, the direction in which the particle moves depends upon 
  the vector summation of the vectors between the particle and each solenoid. 
  This allows you to move the particle in a location that directly points 
  towards the goal location.
  \n
  You are able to control the current in each solenoid which is normalized 
  between 0.0 and 1.0. You can set the current value with a precision of 3 
  decimal places. You must output a list with 8 current values with format 
  [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h] where current 'a' represents the current of 
  solenoid 'a', 'b' represents the current of solenoid 'b' and so on.\n
  \n 
  A good step-by-step approach to solve the problem would be:\n
  1) Find the vector from the particle to the goal\n
  2) Find vectors between the particle and each solenoid\n
  3) Determine which vectors point have a positive projection on the 
  particle-goal vector\n
  4) Turn on the solenoids corresponding to these vectors with magnitudes 
  scaled according the magnitudes of the projections.\n
  \n
  Your output should only consist of these calculations:\n
  - p: Particle location\n
  - g: Goal location\n
  - V: Vector difference between particle and goal location\n
  - v: List of vectors from particle to solenoids keeping the same order as 
  currents list\n
  - proj: Projection of each v on V with sign\n
  - currents: List containing current values with no negative currents\n
  These must be outputted in the order shown above with JSON format. Do not 
  add quotation marks around any of the values in the list. Do not print the 
  description of the variables provided after ':'.\n
  Do not output any code or explanation.\n"
